                           <h1>Who’s afraid of the Form 1040?</h1>
    <p>The vast majority of Americans keep their distance from the 1040. <a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Dec-26-2014">At least 84 percent of us don’t even do our own taxes</a>, instead relying on accountants, tax preparers, and software programs to figure out what we owe or what we’re getting back.  

But really, there’s little to fear. For most of us, our taxes are fairly straightforward—we report our income, take a standard deduction, and either pay what we owe or wait for our refund to arrive. It might not seem like it, but the process was designed to be foolproof. Simply follow the instructions, do a little math, and you’re set.

But when you’re staring down 79 lines that ask about mysterious things like the alternative minimum tax or whether you paid tuition and fees or what your capital gains are, it’s easy to feel a little intimidated.

Here, experts from the <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/">Tax Policy Center</a> give you the information you need to help conquer your fears. Follow along as they break down some important sections of the most-common and most-dreaded income tax form.

<h5>•	<b>Unmarried:</b> If, as of December 31, you’re not married and have no dependents, you must file as single. Have kids? You may file as head of household, which increases your standard deduction and may make you eligible for larger tax benefits.</h5>

<h5>•	<b>Married:</b> If you’re married, you must file a married return. Filing jointly gives you the largest standard deduction and typically makes you eligible for larger tax benefits. Some married couples find they owe less tax if they file separately, but generally, filing separately will cost you more.

						<a href="#"  data-title="You, your spouse, and your dependents: The tax unit" data-description="

<h4>Families—spouses and/or dependents—filing together are what is called a “tax unit.” Who qualifies as a dependent? </h4>

<h5>•	<b>Your children</b> who are under age 19, students under age 24, or permanently and totally disabled, count as dependents as long as they have lived with you for more than half of the year and you provided more than half of their support in 2014. Children who were born or died during the year count as long as they lived with you at least half of the year.<br>
<h5>•	<b>Close relatives or others who live with you as a member of your household</b> can also count as dependents, as long as you provide more than half of their total support.<br>

Having dependents can reduce your tax burden. For 2014, you may reduce your taxable income by $3,950 for yourself and each of your qualifying dependents.  Children may qualify you for some tax credits, including the child credit, the child and dependent care credit, larger earned income credits, and education credits.</h5>
<h5>•	You can claim up to a $1,000 <b>child tax credit</b> for each child under age 17. </h5>
<h5>•	You’re eligible for <b>child care credits</b> if you paid for child care for kids under age 13 so you could go to work or school full time. The credit equals as much as 35 percent of up to $3,000 of childcare expenses ($6,000 for two or more children).</h5>
<h5>•	The <b>earned income tax credit (EITC)</b> was originally available only to low-income families with children. Subsequent changes extended the credit to childless workers, made the credit larger for families with more than one child, and raised income limits, particularly for married couples filing joint tax returns. Determining eligibility for EITC requires following a three-page worksheet (with two pages of instructions) and at least one additional worksheet to determine the amount of the credit (unless you want the IRS to calculate it for you). It’s not a simple process, but it’s worth it for those who are eligible.</h5>

						<a href="#" data-title="Itemizing your deductions: Schedule A
" data-description="
<h4>Rather than claiming the standard deduction, you have the option to itemize. About a third of taxpayers choose this option, listing amounts spent on items like medical expenses, state and local taxes, mortgage interest, and charitable donations. </h4>


<h5><b>Medical deductions</b></br>Did you spend a large out-of-pocket amount on medical and dental expenses? You can deduct the cost of those services that exceed 10 percent of your AGI (or 7.5 percent if you’re older than 65). </br>

In 2012, 10.2 million tax returns contained itemized deductions for $85 billion of medical and dental expenses, an average of $8,350 per return. </h5>


	
<h5><b>Deductions for state and local taxes paid</b></br>Certain taxes you pay to state and local governments can be itemized and deducted. Permanent law allows deduction of state and local income taxes, real estate taxes, and personal property taxes, such as those paid on boats or recreational vehicles. Temporary law allows taxpayers to deduct state and local sales taxes instead of income taxes. </br>

In 2012, 44.5 million taxpayers itemized a total of $483 billion in taxes. The deduction for state and local taxes is one of the major tax preferences taken away by the AMT. It is a major reason why taxpayers in high-tax states are more than twice as likely to be on the AMT as those in low-tax states: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?DocID=3969 &quot;&gt; 4.2 percent vs. 1.9 percent.&lt;/a&gt; </h5>


	
<h5><b>Deduction for interest paid</b></br>You can deduct—within limits—interest and points paid on home mortgages and investment interest expenses. The mortgage interest deduction is limited in two ways: borrowing to buy, build, or improve a home is only deductible up to $1 million, and all other borrowing backed by a home cannot exceed $100,000. Homeowners can also deduct points paid to finance or refinance a home and mortgage insurance premiums (for homes purchased after 2006).</br>

The main effect of the mortgage interest deduction is to encourage people to buy more expensive homes. Because these tax preferences related to homeownership are deductions, they are upside-down subsidies that give the largest benefits to taxpayers with the highest incomes. </br>

In 2012, more than 35 million tax filers itemized $354 billion of interest payments, 94 percent of which was for mortgage interest and the balance for investment interest expenses.</h5>

	
<h5><b>Deduction for charitable contributions</b></br>You can deduct contributions made in cash or in kind to charitable organizations, but deductions may be limited to a percentage of your AGI. </br>

You should receive a receipt for each donation made worth more than $250, minus any tangible value you receive (such as magazine subscriptions). Keep those receipts—you’ll need them to claim the deduction.</br>

Donors get particularly large benefits from donating appreciated assets because they can deduct the full current value of the donated assets without paying income tax on capital gains they have accrued but not realized. In essence, the capital gains go untaxed while the donor deducts the asset’s full value.</br>

In 2012, 37 million tax returns deducted just under $200 billion of charitable donations, three-quarters of which were cash gifts. Taxpayers with AGI over $1 million claimed roughly 30 percent of all charitable deductions taken that year.</h5>



<h5><b>Other deductions</b></br>There are other expenses you can deduct, but often only if they exceed specified shares of your income. These include unreimbursed personal casualty and theft losses over 10 percent of AGI; unreimbursed employee expenses (such as job travel and union dues), various investment expenses, and tax preparation fees over 2 percent of AGI; and gambling losses only to the extent that they offset gambling winnings reported as income. </br>

In 2012, more than 28 million returns itemized more than $130 billion of these deductions but because of limitations, only about 12 million taxpayers could actually deduct only about $95 billion.</h5>

You’ve got wages to report. You’re in good company—wages and salary are by far the largest source of income. In 2012, 83 percent of all federal income tax returns reported wages and salary income.</h5>

<h5>•	<b>Interest and dividends:</b> Did your bank or broker send you a 1099-INT? You should report that interest income, though it might not be taxed. In 2012, tax returns reported $112 billion of taxable interest and $71 billion of tax-exempt interest.<br>

Did you receive a 1099-DIV? Your dividend income is subject to federal income tax, but the tax rate depends on whether your dividends are “qualified” or “nonqualified.” (Less than 10 percent of dividend income reported on 2012 tax returns was nonqualified: $2.5 billion out of $28 billion.)</h5>

<h5>•	<b>Alimony:</b> Any alimony payments you receive are subject to federal income tax at ordinary tax rates. Don’t leave it out: Your former spouse may deduct the amount paid from taxable income but only if s/he reports your Social Security number on his/her tax return. So the IRS knows you got it. <br>

Nevertheless, the amount of alimony reported as paid greatly exceeds the amount reported as received. In 2012, 623,000 tax returns reported payment of $11.2 billion of alimony, but only 440,000 returns reported receiving just $8.9 billion. (That’s not necessarily a sign that recipients are cheating on their taxes—some of them have too little income to have to file a return.)</h5>

<h5>•	<b>Business income and taxes: </b>Do you own a business? If you’re the sole proprietor, income from your business is taxed on your individual income tax return as ordinary income. You’re also on the hook for self-employment tax, which funds Social Security and Medicare (the equivalent of payroll taxes paid by wage and salary employees).<br>

As a sole proprietor, you can contribute to specified retirement accounts and purchase health insurance coverage for yourself and your dependents; you can then deduct contributions to retirement plans and the premiums paid for health insurance.</h5>

<h5>•	<b>Capital gains:</b> &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urban.org/publications/1001583.html &quot;&gt;  The tax you pay on capital gains&lt;/a&gt;—the profit or loss from the sale of a capital asset like a residence, a stock, even collectible art—depends on how long you owned the asset. Gains on assets owned for less than one year are short-term gains and are taxed at ordinary tax rates. Gains on assets owned for one year or longer are long-term gains, earning them preferential tax treatment.<br>

In January, President Obama proposed to push the top capital gains tax rate from 23.8 percent to 28 percent. Will this affect your taxes? Probably not—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/01/20/map-who-would-pay-higher-taxes-under-obamas-capital-gains-proposal/ &quot;&gt; in 2012, just 16 percent of filers reported capital gains at all and less than 1 percent of taxpayers have income high enough to pay the proposed higher tax on their gains. &lt;/a&gt;</h5>

<h5>•	Individual retirement accounts (IRAs): If you’re under age 70 and meet income limit requirements, you may deduct up to $5,500 ($6,500 if you’re over age 50) contributed to deductible IRAs. Withdrawals before age 59½ may face additional taxes and penalties.<br>

What about Roth IRAs? If you’re under age 70 with income below $129,000 ($191,000 for couples filing jointly), you may contribute up to $5,500 ($6,500 for those over age 50) to a Roth IRA instead of a regular IRA (but the limits apply to combined contributions to both kinds of IRAs). You can’t deduct contributions to Roth IRAs, but you’ll pay no income tax when you make allowed withdrawals.</h5>

<h5>•	Pensions and annuities: Pension and annuity income is subject to ordinary tax rates to an extent. There’s no tax on the portion of retirement payments that represent an employee’s contributions to the plan that came from taxable earnings; the rest is taxed at ordinary tax rates.</h5>

<h5>•	Social Security: Social Security benefits are not taxed if the recipient’s countable income is less than $25,000 ($32,000 for joint filers and $0 for married couples filing separately). Recipients with income above those thresholds pay tax on a rising share of their benefits—up to 50 percent if countable income is less than $34,000 ($44,000 for joint filers), and up to 85 percent for those with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/countableincome.html &quot;&gt; countable income&lt;/a&gt; beyond that amount.</h5>

There are also tax-friendly ways to save for education expenses, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch07.html&quot;&gt; Coverdell education savings accounts &lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch08.html&quot;&gt; qualified tuition programs &lt;/a&gt; (or “529 plans”), both of which offer tax-free withdrawals, as long as these withdrawals are used for allowed expenses. </br>

All tax preferences for education are coordinated to prevent using more than one for the same expenses. For example, you can’t claim an American opportunity tax credit for tuition paid using funds from a qualified tuition program. But you can claim more than one benefit for a single student, as long as they apply to different expenses. </h5>

Did you use ACA premium support to obtain health insurance coverage through exchanges? In that case, you must calculate the support you should have received based on your actual 2014 income and either repay any excess or claim additional support. </br>

Did you neglect to get insurance at all?
