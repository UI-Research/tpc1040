        <h1>Who’s afraid of the Form 1040?</h1>
        <p> Almost <a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Dec-26-2014">150 million Americans</a> filed tax returns in 2014. <a href="http://www.irs.gov/file_source/pub/irs-soi/12intaba.xls">Nearly half</a> used the allegedly simple 1040A or the even simpler 1040EZ. Regardless of which form we use, though, most of us find the process daunting. More than half hire someone to prepare our returns and almost all of the rest of us use software programs to figure out what we owe or how big a refund we’ll get.</p><br>

        <p>It wasn’t always this way. For its first quarter century, the income tax only applied to a tiny sliver of the population, who <a href="http://www.taxhistory.org/thp/readings.nsf/cf7c9c870b600b9585256df80075b9dd/131bf2e3cb636d6985256eb300588d4a?OpenDocument">filed on March 15</a> (yes, the Ides of March). But things changed when we needed a whole lot of revenue to finance World War II. Payroll withholding was invented, which enlisted the help of employers to collect taxes in bite-sized chunks out of every paycheck and, voila, the class tax became a mass tax. Most of us became familiar with the annual ritual of settling up with the IRS. About three-quarters of us get refunds because withholding exceeds our tax bill. These refunds may lessen the sting a bit, but the whole process is still awfully complicated.</p><br>

        <p>For tax year 2014, Form 1040 includes 79 lines that ask about mysterious things, like if you qualify for alternative minimum tax or whether you paid tuition and fees or if you had any capital gains. It’s easy to feel a little intimidated.</p><br>

        <p>Here, experts from the <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/">Tax Policy Center</a> give you the information you need to help conquer your fears. Follow along as they break down some important sections of the most-common and most-dreaded income tax form.

          <a href="#" data-title="Filing Status" data-description="<h5>Step one of filling out your 1040: figuring out your filing status.</h5>

<h5>• <b>Unmarried:</b> If you weren’t married on December 31 and have no dependents, you must file as single. Have kids? You may file as <b>head of household</b>, which increases your standard deduction, widens the tax brackets, and boosts some other tax breaks. </h5>

<h5>• <b>Married:</b> If you’re married, you must file a married return. Filing jointly gives you the largest standard deduction and typically makes you eligible for larger tax benefits. Some married couples find they owe less tax if they file separately, but, generally, filing separately will cost you more.</h5>

                                                                                 
<h5>Filing status sounds kind of neutral, but it’s the origin of marriage penalties and bonuses. Depending on your and your spouse’s individual incomes, you may receive a marriage bonus—pay less tax than you would if you both were single—or pay a marriage penalty—pay more tax than you’d pay if single.</h5>
                                                                                 
<h5>Marriage bonuses were born in 1948, when Congress created joint filing—before that, everyone had to file an individual return. For the next two decades, marriage could only reduce your taxes. But in the 1960s, Vivien Kellems formed a group called <i>&lt;a href=&quot;https://books.google.com/books?id=BUonMfhHPDIC&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=kellem+war+widows+of+america+vivian&source=bl&ots=BJyPKoJSP7&sig=4dCyXqUlJnLVvvPySvIsNCq_7_0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=fSn5VPGfJIHsgwSyioC4AQ&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=kellem%20war%20widows%20of%20america%20vivian&f=false&quot; target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;War Widows of America&lt;/a&gt;</i> to protest how unfair the income tax was to singles. (She wasn’t a widow of any sort, but it was good marketing.) In 1969, Congress addressed this perceived inequity by cutting taxes on singles and thus creating marriage penalties. Since then, the pendulum has swung back and forth. Bonuses are now more prevalent, but some couples suffer penalties, most often when spouses have similar incomes.</h5>

          <a href="#" data-title="You, your spouse, and your dependents: The tax unit" data-description="

<h5>Have you ever heard the old aphorism, “A family who files together smiles together?” We haven’t either. But spouses and dependents who file together are special in the tax world: they’re a “tax unit.” Who qualifies as a dependent?</h5>

<h5>• <b>Your children</b> if they were under age 19 at the end of 2014, students under age 24, or permanently and totally disabled, as long as they lived with you for more than half of the year and you provided most of their support in 2014. Newborns count if they lived with you at least half of the time since their birth. Children who died count if they lived with you half of the time they were alive in 2014. Children &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.irs.gov/publications/p501/ar02.html#en_US_2014_publink1000220875&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt; held by kidnappers also count&lt;/a&gt;. </h5>
                                                                                                                        
<h5>• <b>Close relatives or others who live with you as a member of your household</b>, as long as they had income below $3,950 in 2014 and you provided most of their support.</h5>
                                                                                                                        
<h5>Having dependents can reduce your tax burden. That’s why there’s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1086/250054?uid=3739936&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21106043330913&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;surge of births &lt;/a&gt; at the end of each year. For 2014, you may reduce your taxable income by $3,950 for yourself, your spouse, and each of your qualifying dependents—&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/background/issues/phaseouts.cfm&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;as long as your income wasn’t too high&lt;/a&gt;. Children may qualify you for some tax breaks, including the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/key-elements/family/ctc.cfm&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;child credit&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/press/quickfacts_cdctc.cfm&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;child and dependent care credit &lt;/a&gt;, larger &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/key-elements/family/eitc.cfm&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;earned income credits&lt;/a&gt;, and education benefits.</h5>
<h5>• You may claim a $1,000 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/key-elements/family/ctc.cfm&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;child tax credit &lt;/a&gt;<b>(CTC)</b> for each child under age 17 as of December 31, unless your income was too high. Like other credits, this one offsets tax liability dollar for dollar, but it’s even better than that because low-income working families can get a refund of all or part of the credit in excess of tax liability. This kind of credit—called a refundable credit—is especially valuable to low-income families with little or no income tax liability.</h5>
                                                                                                                        
<h5>• You’re eligible for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/press/quickfacts_cdctc.cfm&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;child care credits&lt;/a&gt; if you paid for child care for kids under age 13 so you could go to work or attend school full time. The credit can be as much as 35 percent of up to $3,000 of child care expenses ($6,000 for two or more children). </h5>

<h5>Unlike the CTC, the credit is nonrefundable—it can only offset taxes you owe. As a result, most low-income families get little or no benefit from it. For example, in 2015, a two-parent family with two children and an adjusted gross income (AGI) of $28,600 or less owes no income tax. For them, the child care credit is a good news/bad news story. The good news: if they spent $3,000 on qualifying child care, they theoretically qualify for an $840 credit. The bad news: because they have no income tax liability, the credit is worthless. </h5>   
                                                                                                                        
<h5>• Low-income workers may claim the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/key-elements/family/eitc.cfm&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;earned income tax credit&lt;/a&gt; <b>(EITC)</b>. Eligibility depends on your income, marital status, and how many children you have. The credit is smallest for childless workers—no more than $496 in 2014—but can be as large as $6,242 for a married couple with three or more children. And the credit is fully refundable, so it’s especially valuable to low-income households. Indeed, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2014/demo/p60-251.pdf&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;Census Bureau estimates&lt;/a&gt; that, in 2013, the EITC and the refundable portion of the CTC reduced the overall poverty rate by 3 percentage points and by more than 6 points among children. (We’re talking about the “supplemental poverty measure” because the standard measure &lt;a href=&quot;http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/2011/11/07/news-flash-antipoverty-programs-can-reduce-poverty/&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;doesn’t take many antipoverty programs into account&lt;/a&gt;, like the EITC. Go figure!)</h5>

<h5>Claiming the EITC is complex, which is one reason most poor families get help filing their taxes. Determining eligibility for EITC requires filling out a three-page worksheet (following two pages of instructions) and at least one additional worksheet to determine the amount of the credit (unless you want the IRS to calculate it for you). In part because of its complexity, the EITC has significant problems with errors and fraud. The definition of a qualifying child is complex: it depends on with whom the child lives during the year, who claims the child as a dependent on tax returns, and who provides support for the child.

        <li>
          <a href="#" data-title="Your income" data-description="<h5>How much money did you make in 2014 and how? Here are some of the most common income items.</h5>
<h5>• <b>Wage and salary income:</b> If you got a W-2 from your employer, you’ve got wages to report. You’re in good company—wages and salary are by far the largest source of income. In 2012, 83 percent of all federal income tax returns reported wages and salary income, which made up just over two-thirds of total AGI. (This and income from self-employment make up the “earned income” that is the basis for the EITC.)
</h5>
 <h5>•  <b>Interest:</b> Did your bank or broker send you a 1099-INT? You should report that interest income, but it won’t necessarily be taxed. In 2012, tax returns reported $112 billion of taxable interest and $71 billion of tax-exempt interest, most often the interest paid on municipal bonds. This lowers the cost for state and local governments to finance big public investments, like schools and highways, as well as some private activities, such as stadiums. However, it’s a costly way to help municipal governments since their interest savings are significantly less than the revenue loss to the feds. And it’s a bit of a scam for many taxpayers who invest in the bonds because the interest is tax-free. Sounds great but the bonds pay less interest than taxable ones. Unless you’re in a high tax bracket, the loss from the lower interest rate is greater than your tax savings. But the promise of not owing tax on the interest gets a lot of people to buy municipal bonds who would be better off buying taxable bonds. </h5>
                                                                               
<h5>• <b>Dividends:</b> These are reported on form 1099-DIV. There are two kinds of dividends: qualified and nonqualified. Qualified dividends, which are paid on corporate stock, are taxed at the lower capital gains tax rates based on the logic that that income was already subject to the corporate income tax (even though a lot of corporate income escapes tax). The rest, nonqualified dividends, are taxed like other income. (Only about a fifth of dividend income reported on 2012 tax returns was nonqualified: $56 billion out of $260 billion.)</h5>
                                                                               
<h5>• <b>Alimony:</b> Divorce also &lt;a href=&quot;http://taxlawchannel.squarespace.com/robert-wood-commentary/2012/7/18/divorce-and-taxes-featuring-tax-attorney-robert-wood.html&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;raises tax issues&lt;/a&gt;. Any alimony payments you received are taxed at ordinary tax rates. Don’t leave them out. Your former spouse may deduct the amount paid from taxable income but only if s/he reports your Social Security number on her/his tax return. So the IRS knows you have it.</h5>

<h5>Nevertheless, the amount of alimony reported as paid greatly exceeds the amount reported as received. In 2012, 623,000 tax returns reported payment of $11.2 billion of alimony, but only 440,000 returns reported receiving just $8.9 billion. (That doesn’t necessarily mean that recipients cheated on their taxes—some of them had too little income to have to file a return.)</h5>
                                                                               
 <h5>•  <b>Business income:</b> Do you own a business? If you were the sole proprietor in 2014, earnings from your business are taxed on your individual income tax return as ordinary income. You’re also on the hook for self-employment tax, which funds Social Security and Medicare (the equivalent of payroll taxes paid by wage and salary employees), but you can deduct part of the tax you paid.</h5>

 <h5>Sole proprietors get to deduct business expenses, such as wages paid, equipment costs, and health insurance premiums. Because there’s no third-party reporting of self-employment income (i.e., they don’t get a W-2 like employees), they are much more prone to cheating. They tend to overstate deductions and understate income. Did you ever wonder why your painter prefers to be paid in cash? (They’re also not great about complying with state sales taxes.) The IRS &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.irs.gov/pub/newsroom/overview_tax_gap_2006.pdf&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that, in 2006, unincorporated businesses fell short on their income tax obligations by $122 billion and underpaid self-employment tax by $57 billion.</h5>    

<h5>• <b>Capital gains:</b> &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/1001583-tax-rates-on-cap-gains.pdf&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;The tax you pay on capital gains&lt;/a&gt;—the profit or loss from the sale of an asset like shares of stock, a residence or business, or collectible art—depends on how long you owned the asset. Gains on assets owned for a year or less are short-term gains and are taxed at ordinary tax rates. Gains on assets owned for more than a year are long-term gains, which face lower tax rates. Rates range from 0 percent for lower-income taxpayers to 23.8 percent. The same low rates apply to qualified dividends. By contrast, other investment income is subject to rates as high as 43.4 percent.</h5>

<h5>In January, President Obama proposed to push the top capital gains tax rate to 28 percent. Would this affect your taxes? Probably not, even if Congress raises the rate: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/01/20/map-who-would-pay-higher-taxes-under-obamas-capital-gains-proposal/&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;in 2012, just 16 percent of filers reported capital gains, and less than 1 percent of taxpayers had income high enough to pay the proposed higher tax on their gains&lt;/a&gt;.</h5>

          <a href="#" data-title="Adjusted gross income" data-description="<h5>Your AGI is the sum of your income from all sources minus “above-the-line” deductions—specific reductions for particular expenses. For example, within limits, you may deduct interest you paid on student loans, moving expenses to take a new job, contributions to an individual retirement account (IRA) or a health savings account, and, if you’re a teacher, money you spent on classroom supplies. </h5> 
<h5>AGI is widely used throughout the tax code to determine whether you are eligible for tax preferences or if you have to pay additional tax. Because AGI excludes income from particular sources, eligibility for some tax preferences depends on a separately defined “modified AGI,” which adds in some nontaxable income, such as tax-exempt interest.</h5>

<h5>Rather than claiming the standard deduction, you have the option to itemize. Only about a third of taxpayers choose this option, listing amounts they spent on items like medical expenses, state and local taxes, mortgage interest, and charitable donations. The standard deduction was intended as a simplification—most people don’t have to keep track of their charitable contributions and other potential deductions. A touted simplification of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was the big increase in the standard deduction, which vastly reduced the number of itemizers (and also removed most families below the poverty level from the tax rolls). But a lot of people think it’s unfair that they can’t deduct their charitable contributions or mortgage interest (never mind that the standard deduction is a better deal). For that reason, many tax reform proposals would dispense with itemization altogether.</h5>

<h5>There’s another wrinkle that affects only people with high income: the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/press/press-resources-pease.cfm&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;limitation on itemized deductions&lt;/a&gt;, or “Pease,” as tax wonks call it. (Donald Pease was the Ohio congressman who proposed the idea.) This provision reduces your itemized deductions by 3 percent of your AGI over a threshold amount: $305,050 for joint filers, $279,650 for heads of household, $254,200 for singles, and $152,525 for married couples filing separately. Cold comfort: you can’t lose more than 80 percent of what you’ve itemized. In 2011, 20 million taxpayers lost some of their itemized deductions to Pease, although that number is much lower in 2014 because &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/UploadedPDF/412730-Tax-Provisions-in-ATRA.pdf&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012&lt;/a&gt; significantly raised the income levels at with deductions phase out.</h5><br>
                    
<h5><b>Medical deductions</b></br>Did you spend a lot on medical and dental expenses that insurance didn’t reimburse? You can deduct the cost of those services that exceed 10 percent of your AGI (or 7.5 percent if you’re 65 or older). </h5>

<h5>In 2012, 10.2 million tax returns claimed itemized deductions for $85 billion of medical and dental expenses, an average of $8,350 per return. </h5><br>

  
<h5><b>Deductions for state and local taxes paid</b><br>
You can itemize and deduct certain taxes you pay to state and local governments. Permanent law allows deduction of state and local income taxes, real estate taxes, and personal property taxes, such as those paid on boats or recreational vehicles. Temporary law allows taxpayers to deduct state and local sales taxes instead of income taxes.</h5>

<h5>In 2012, 44.5 million taxpayers itemized a total of $483 billion in taxes. This deduction is one of the tax preferences taken away by the AMT and is a major reason why taxpayers in high-tax states are more than twice as likely to be on the AMT as those in low-tax states: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?DocID=3969&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;4.5 percent vs. 1.9 percent&lt;/a&gt;.
</h5><br>


  
<h5><b>Mortgage interest deduction</b><br>
  
You can deduct—within limits—interest and points paid on home mortgages (as well as net investment interest). The mortgage interest deduction is limited in two ways: borrowing to buy, build, or improve a home is only deductible up to $1 million, and all other borrowing backed by a home cannot exceed $100,000. Homeowners can also deduct mortgage insurance premiums (for homes purchased after 2006) and points paid to reduce mortgage interest rates.</h5>

<h5>The mortgage interest deduction appears to have little impact on US homeownership rates and it might even hurt by pushing up housing prices. Its main effect is to encourage people to buy more expensive homes. And because they are deductions that only benefit taxpayers who itemize, these tax breaks are most valuable to taxpayers with the highest incomes who probably don’t need help paying for housing. Our neighbor Canada doesn’t allow a deduction for mortgage interest and 
&lt;a href=&quot;
http://blogs.seattletimes.com/opinionnw/2013/08/12/homeownership-in-the-united-states-versus-canada/&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;its homeownership rate is virtually identical to ours&lt;/a&gt;.</h5>

<h5>In 2012, more than 35 million tax filers itemized $354 billion of interest payments, 94 percent of which were for mortgage interest and the balance for investment interest expenses.</h5><br>
       
                    
<h5><b>Deduction for charitable contributions</b><br>
  
You can deduct contributions made in cash or in kind to charitable organizations, but deductions may be limited to a percentage of your AGI. </h5>

<h5>For donations worth more than $250, you’ll need receipts stating the value of the donations, minus any tangible value the donor receives (such as magazine subscriptions). The IRS can deny your deductions if you haven’t gotten receipts before you file your taxes.</h5>

<h5>Donors get particularly large benefits from donating appreciated assets because they can deduct the full current value of the donated assets without paying income tax on capital gains they have accrued but not realized. In essence, the capital gains go untaxed while the donor deducts the asset’s full value.</h5>

<h5>In 2012, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.irs.gov/file_source/pub/irs-soi/12in21id.xls&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;37 million tax returns deducted just under $200 billion of charitable donations&lt;/a&gt;, three-quarters of which were cash gifts. Judging from tax data, most people don’t follow the biblical prescript to tithe (donate 10 percent). The average donation among people who itemized was 3.2 percent of AGI in 2012. Taxpayers with AGI over $1 million claimed roughly 30 percent of all charitable deductions that year and gave an average of 4.4 percent of their income.
</h5><br>
                    
<h5><b>Other deductions</b><br>

There are other expenses you can deduct, but often only if they exceed specified shares of your income. These include unreimbursed personal casualty and theft losses over 10 percent of AGI (less $100), unreimbursed employee expenses (such as job travel and union dues), various investment expenses, tax preparation fees over 2 percent of AGI; some legal fees; and gambling losses only to the extent that they offset gambling winnings reported as income. And in the tax consequences of nightmare scenarios category: casualty and theft losses include costs of

<h5>In 2012, more than 28 million returns listed more than $130 billion of these deductions, but, because of limitations such as the 10 percent floor on casualty losses, only about 12 million taxpayers could actually deduct only about $95 billion.</h5>

<h5>Two sets of tax rates apply, depending on the source of income. For most income, you pay ordinary rates that range from 10 percent on the first $9,075 to 39.6 percent on taxable income over $406,750 if you’re single. Tax brackets are bigger for heads of household—the 10 percent bracket ends at $12,950—and bigger yet for joint filers. </h5>

<h5>Long-term capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed at lower rates. The rate is 0 if your tax rate on ordinary income is 15 percent or lower—your gains and dividends go untaxed. At the other extreme, if your income is high enough to put you in the 39.6 percent tax bracket, you pay a 20 percent tax. If you owe tax on gains or dividends, figuring out how much tax you owe is MUCH more complicated: you have to use a complicated 27-line worksheet (or an even more complicated 45-line worksheet) to calculate your tax bill.</h5>

          <a href="#" data-title="Alternative minimum tax" data-description="<h5>Back in 1969, Treasury Secretary Joseph Barr reported to Congress that 155 high-income tax units—people making more than $200,000 a year—had paid no income tax in 1967. This caused a firestorm of protest, to which Congress responded by creating the first minimum tax—basically, an extra tax that high-income households had to pay if they’d taken so much advantage of the tax breaks that Congress created that they were paying an embarrassingly low amount of tax.</h5>

<h5>The minimum tax morphed and mutated over time to become the dreaded &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/AMT_tables_2013.cfm&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;alternative minimum tax&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/quick_amt.cfm#6&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;AMT&lt;/a&gt;)—the epitome of pointless complexity in the tax code. Basically, after you think you’re done with your tax calculations, you have to add a bunch of other so-called “preference items” to income and calculate tax again under the AMT rules. If that tax bill is higher than your regular tax, you pay the difference as AMT. Some people first find out that they owe AMT when the IRS writes and tells them that they owe extra tax.</h5>

<h5>Although it was supposed to ensure that high earners paid at least some income tax, it does a poor job of it: in any given year, roughly 1,000 tax units with income over $1 million pay no US income tax. Instead of egregious tax shelters, the things most likely to throw you on the AMT are moderately high income ($100,000 to $500,000), lots of kids, and high state and local taxes. (Personal exemptions and the deduction for state and local taxes are not allowed under the AMT.)</h5>

<h5>Congress has periodically tweaked the parameters so that not too many people will write and complain. Only 2.9 percent of all tax filers &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?DocID=3969&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;will owe the added tax &lt;/a&gt;in 2014. But the AMT can be a big hit if you owe it—the additional levy will boost tax bills this year by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?DocID=3970&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;an average of more than $6,500 for&lt;/a&gt; affected taxpayers. </h5>

<h5>A weird effect of the AMT: if you’re stuck paying it, you should itemize your deductions, even if the standard deduction would be larger. That’s because the AMT disallows the standard deduction but lets you keep some itemized deductions. </h5>

          <a href="#" data-title="Retirement savings and income" data-description="<h5>Three things you should know about retirement savings and taxes: 1) your contributions may be deducted from your taxable income (except for nondeductible “Roth” accounts, which confer the tax benefits upon withdrawal); 2) earnings are not taxed as they accrue; and 3) withdrawals are taxed if you deducted your contributions, but otherwise they’re usually not taxable.</h5>

<h5>• Individual retirement accounts (IRAs): If you’re younger than 70 and meet income limits, you may deduct up to $5,500 ($6,500 if you’re age 50 or older) contributed to traditional IRAs. Withdrawals before age 59½ may face additional taxes and penalties. The down side: you pay income tax when you withdraw funds—and you have to start withdrawals once you hit age 70½. Happy half birthday!</h5>
                                                                                                 

<h5>What about Roth IRAs? If you’re younger than 70 with income below $129,000 ($191,000 for couples filing jointly), you may contribute up to $5,500 ($6,500 for those age 50 or older) to a Roth IRA instead of a regular IRA (but the limits apply to combined contributions to both kinds of IRAs). You can’t deduct contributions to Roth IRAs, but you won’t have to pay income tax on allowed withdrawals. And if you die before you use up your Roth IRA, you can pass what’s left on to your heirs, who can also use the money tax-free.</h5>
                                                                                                 
<h5>If tax rates stay the same over time, you contribute the same amount of after-tax income, and you withdraw it all at the same rate, Roth IRAs and traditional IRAs will produce identical amounts of after-tax retirement income. Both accounts make returns on your saving tax-free. There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/UploadedPDF/1000990_Tax_Break_05-22-06.pdf&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;some meaningful differences&lt;/a&gt; in practice, though, which tend to make Roth IRAs the savings vehicle of choice for people who are rich enough that they don’t actually need savings to pay for retirement. One big difference: you can save more in a Roth IRA because, unlike traditional IRAs, the entire balance is tax-free.</h5>

<h5>• Pensions and annuities: Pension and annuity income is taxed at ordinary rates as you receive it. There’s no tax on the portion representing your contributions from taxed earnings, but you have to pay tax on the rest.</h5>

<h5>• Social Security: You pay no tax on Social Security benefits if your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/countableincome.html
&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;countable income&lt;/a&gt; was less than $25,000 ($32,000 for joint filers and $0 for married couples filing separately). But if your income was above those thresholds, you’ll owe tax on a rising share of your benefits—up to 85 percent of benefits for those with high incomes. (Believe it or not, it’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbo.gov/publication/49948&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;even more complicated&lt;/a&gt; than it sounds.) This tax was created with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ssa.gov/history/1983amend2.html&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;Social Security Amendments of 1983&lt;/a&gt; to help pay for Social Security; all of the revenue it collects goes into the Social Security trust fund.</h5>

          <a href="#" data-title="Health insurance provisions" data-description="<h5>What does health insurance have to do with taxes? In 2014, a lot.</h5>

<h5>
The best deal is for those who get insurance at work: you don’t pay tax on the premiums your employer pays for health insurance even though it’s part of compensation. Dollarwise, that’s the biggest tax break of all—it saved taxpayers an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2016/assets/ap_14_expenditures.pdf&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;estimated $206 billion in income taxes and $128 billion in payroll taxes&lt;/a&gt; in fiscal year 2015 alone. Because the value of the tax break depends on your tax bracket, it tends to be most valuable to those with high incomes who don’t really need help paying for insurance: you save 10 percent of the value of premiums if you’re in the 10 percent bracket, but you save about 40 percent if you’re in the top bracket. The tax break is also complicit in the rapid growth of health care costs because it steers employees into expensive insurance plans that insulate participants from many of the costs of health care. Reducing that effect was a major motivation for the so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/high-cost-excise-tax/&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;“Cadillac” health plan excise tax&lt;/a&gt;, enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and scheduled to take effect in 2018 (and also the answer to the trivia question, “How is health insurance like a car?”).
</h5>
                                                                                               
<h5>The ACA added many other tax provisions that show up on individual income tax returns, including the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Questions-and-Answers-for-the-Additional-Medicare-Tax&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;additional Medicare tax&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/Net-Investment-Income-Tax-FAQs&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;net investment income tax&lt;/a&gt;, both of which affect only high-income taxpayers.</h5> 
                                                                                               
<h5>Most notably, the subsidies that help low- and moderate-income individuals and families pay for insurance purchased through exchanges come in the form of the premium tax credit—a refundable credit that can offset most of the cost of health insurance. Many people who purchased health insurance coverage through exchanges claimed the credits in advance based on a projection of income for the year. If you did and your income increased, you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbpp.org/files/QA-on-Premium-Credits.pdf#page=8&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;may have to pay back part or all of the subsidy&lt;/a&gt; on your 2014 income tax return. If your credit turned out to be too small, you can collect the difference as a reduction in tax or a refund.</h5>
                                                                                               
<h5>Did you neglect to get insurance at all? If you didn’t have coverage for at least nine months during 2014 you must pay an “individual responsibility tax” unless you qualify for one of several &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthcare.gov/fees-exemptions/exemptions-from-the-fee/&quot;  target=&quot;_blank=&quot;&gt;exemptions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/acacalculator.cfm
